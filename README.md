# Qualys Quest Analysis

![Qualys Quest Analysis Banner](BannerImageLink.png)

## Overview

This project chronicles a comprehensive vulnerability management exercise, where we employed Qualys to scan a Windows VM with outdated applications, then reassessed post-remediation actions, showcasing the effectiveness of vulnerability management protocols.
The "Qualys Quest Analysis" project delineates a systematic approach to vulnerability management using the Qualys platform. We focus on the meticulous analysis of scan data via pivot tables in Google Sheets, highlighting the evolution of system vulnerabilities under varying conditions.

## Goals

1. **Automated Scanning**: Utilize Qualys for automated vulnerability scanning of a Windows VM.
2. **Analysis and Remediation**: Analyze scan results to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
3. **Report Generation**: Produce reports post-remediation to document the findings and the impact of the actions taken.

## Tools and Resources

- **VirtualBox**: To host the Windows VM.
- **Qualys**: For conducting vulnerability scans.
- 
- **Pivot Table Data Analysis**: Employ pivot tables in Google Sheets to organize and analyze scan data, identifying trends and changes in the security posture.
