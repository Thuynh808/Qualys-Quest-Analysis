  - **Risk Assessment:**
    - By understanding the categories, we can prioritize risks based on severity and the nature of the threat. A high number of 'Windows' category vulnerabilities often suggests the need for critical security updates.

  - **Trend Analysis:**
    - Categorization helps in spotting trends such as recurrent types of vulnerabilities. This can inform our security strategy and help prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.

  In our specific case:

  - **Local Category:**
    - With 217 confirmed vulnerabilities under 'Local', this could point to the outdated applications we installed on the system. Firefox being a browser could likely have many variety of web protocols, plugins, and extensions, all of which can act as potential attack surfaces. 

  - **Windows Category:**
    - The 42 items in the 'Windows' category likely represent missing security updates. These are crucial as they often patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. We need to ensure that all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to maintain a secure environment. For this project, no updates were performed before the scan so these 42 could be due to the Windows security updates.

  In conclusion, categorizing vulnerabilities not only streamlines the remediation process but also provides actionable intelligence on security posture and policy development. For our situation, addressing the 'Local' and 'Windows' categories should be prioritized to mitigate the risk of exploitation from outdated applications and unpatched systems.

  - **Step 2: Import and Initial Setup**
    - Open Google Sheets and import the downloaded scan results. 
    - Highlight the metadata section of the header and delete them. We won't be needing them for our pivot tables
    - Select the entire first row which is our 'key' row and click on the `Create a Filter Icon`. Now we can filter using these values.
    - Select everything and right-click to choose `Resize rows` > size `21` which is the default. This isn't for the pivot tables but it does give us a better view of the data.

<summary><h2><b>Section 9: Pivot Table Creation for Trend Reporting</b></h2></summary>

- Pivot tables are invaluable in vulnerability management for organizing and interpreting large datasets. They not only facilitate trend analysis but also assist in visualizing the impact of remediation efforts over time, enabling security teams to prioritize and address the most critical threats effectively.

- Trend reports created from pivot tables offer a dynamic view of vulnerability data, showcasing the progression of security posture improvements as a result of remediation activities. They help to highlight patterns, predict future security challenges, and inform strategic decision-making.

- In this section, we'll cover the steps to export scan data and use it to create pivot tables in Google Sheets. We will then integrate these pivot tables into a trend report that visualizes the reduction in vulnerabilities after each scan, reflecting the success of our remediation efforts. This will include a comparison of vulnerability counts, severities, and types before and after remediation, providing a clear, actionable insight into the effectiveness of our vulnerability management process.
