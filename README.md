# Qualys Quest Analysis

![Qualys Quest Analysis Banner](https://i.imgur.com/GBIvqJF.gif)

## Overview

Qualys is a cloud-based service that provides vulnerability scanning and management. In this project, we'll leverage Qualys to perform comprehensive scans on a Windows virtual machine. We'll start by installing outdated versions of widely used software, WinRAR and Firefox, to simulate a common security oversight. The project will then progress through cycles of remediation and rescanning to measure the impact of updates and security improvements. We'll use Google Sheets to create pivot tables for a clear view of vulnerabilities, aiding in both remediation and reporting. Finally, we'll document the entire process and findings in a detailed report, providing insights into effective vulnerability management practices.


## Tools and Resources

- **VirtualBox**: To host the Windows VM.
- **Windows 10**: The operating system for the VM.
- **Qualys**: For conducting comprehensive vulnerability scans.
- **Google Sheets**: For data analysis and visualization using pivot tables.
- **OldVersion.com**: To source outdated software versions of Firefox and WinRAR.
- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: For referencing detailed vulnerability data.
- **MITRE CVE**: For accessing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures information.

<summary><h2><b>Section 1: Initial Setup</b></h2></summary>
  To begin, we start by preparing our virtual environment for the vulnerability assessment. We'll establish a network, set up a Windows virtual machine, and install outdated versions of software known for their vulnerabilities.<br><br>
  
  - **Step 1: Creating a NAT Network**
    - Open VirtualBox and go to `File > Tools > Host Network Manager`
    - Click on the `NAT Networks` tab and Create with the following details:
      - Name: NatNetwork
      - Ipv4: 10.2.22.0/24
      - DHCP: Enabled

<br><br>

  - **Step 3: Installing Outdated Applications**
    - Open a browser and Search for `Old Version`
    - Click on the `OldVersion.com` link and search for Mozilla Firefox and WinRAR
    - Download and Install both applications

![Installing WinRAR & Firefox](https://i.imgur.com/DEaNp0z.png)<br><br>

  Great! We've now created our Windows VM with outdated versions of Firefox and WinRAR installed. This machine will be used to find vulnerabilities for us to analyze and remediate. Next, we will download and install our Virtual Scanner from Qualys.

<summary><h2><b>Section 2: Setting Up the Virtual Scanner</b></h2></summary>
  This section involves downloading the Qualys Virtual Scanner and configuring it to work with our virtual environment assuming we've already subscribed for the Community Edition of Qualys.<br><br>
  
  - **Step 1: Downloading the Scanner**
    - Access the Qualys platform and in the Getting Started section, click on `Download a virtual scanner`
    - Start the wizard to configure our scanner
    - Choose `VMware ESXi, vCenter Server` as the virtualization platform and provide the name `StreetrackVA` for our scanner
    - Download the scanner appliance image to our local machine
    - Take note of the provided Personalization Code for later use

![Save Virtual Scanner](https://i.imgur.com/iNg3raU.png)<br><br>
![Personalization Code](https://i.imgur.com/BXVDIKb.png)<br><br>

  - **Step 2: Importing and Configuring the Scanner Appliance**
    - In VirtualBox, select `File` > `Import Appliance` and navigate to the downloaded scanner image
    - Follow the prompts to import the scanner appliance
    - Once imported, click on `Settings` > `Network` and choose:
      - Attached to: NAT Network
      - Name: NatNetwork
      
  This will ensure that the scanner and the Windows VM will be on the same network.<br><br>

  - **Step 3: Personalizing the Scanner**
    - Start the scanner VM and use the personalization code provided by Qualys to activate and configure the scanner.
    - We'll be provided the IP address of our scanner once the personalization process is complete.

  - **Step 4: Finalizing Scanner Setup**
    - Once the personalization is complete, verify that the scanner appears in our Qualys account with the correct LAN IP: `10.2.22.6`
    - We'll also perform a connectivity test from the Windows VM to confirm the scanner is reachable.<br><br>
      ```cmd
      ipconfig
      ping 10.2.22.6
      ```
    - **IP Addresses:**
      - Windows VM: 10.2.22.5
      - Qualys Scanner: 10.2.22.6

Awesome! The Qualys Virtual Scanner is now up and running! In the next section, we'll configure our asset for an authenticated scan. 

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2><b>Section 3: Configuring Asset for Authenticated Scan</b></h2></summary>
  Setting up for an authenticated scan ensures a more thorough assessment by allowing the scanner to log into the system. This allows for deeper vulnerability detection. Lets go over the steps to configure our asset, Windows VM, for an authenticated scan.<br><br>

  - **Step 1: Adding VM's IP Range to Qualys Asset Groups**
    - Navigate to the `Assets` tab on the Qualys platform
    - Click `Add IPs for Scanning`
    - Click on `New` > `IP Tracked Addresses`
    - Enter the IP range of: `10.2.22.2-10.2.22.20`
    - Save the configuration to ensure these IPs are included in scans

![Add IPs for Scanning3](https://i.imgur.com/3idJ36o.png)<br><br>

  - **Step 2: Configuring Windows Firewall & Services**
    - On your Windows VM, open the `Windows Defender Firewall` settings.
    - Disable the firewall for private and public networks to allow for unobstructed scanning.
    - Navigate to `Services` and ensure that the `Remote Registry` service is running. This service is needed for Qualys to perform authenticated scans.

  - **Step 3: Finalizing VM Preparation**
    - Confirm that all necessary services are running and the firewall settings are configured.
    - Perform a final check by pinging the Qualys scanner from the VM to ensure network connectivity.

Once these steps are completed, your VM is ready for an authenticated scan using Qualys.
